<p>Welcome to the <strong>ESG Portfolio</strong> project! This is a personal initiative born from my interest in quantitative finance and a desire to explore how we can align investment strategies with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles.</p>
<p>The core idea is to investigate whether it's possible to use publicly available data and established financial techniques to identify investment portfolios that not only aim for strong risk-adjusted returns but also focus on companies with a better ESG profile. This project serves as a learning platform for me and is shared openly for others who are curious about this intersection of finance, data analysis, and sustainability.</p>
<p>Think of this not as a finished product, but as a foundation â€“ a set of tools and ideas I'm developing and sharing, leveraging modern AI-powered coding assistants to accelerate development and explore complex solutions. My hope is that by making this code open source, others interested in sustainable investing and quantitative methods can use it, build upon it, and contribute their own insights and improvements.</p>
<p>The project is primarily composed of two Python scripts: one focused on gathering the necessary financial data, and the other on applying optimization techniques to that data.</p>
