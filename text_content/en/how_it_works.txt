<h4><code>Download.py</code>: Fueling the Analysis with Data</h4>
<p>Good analysis starts with good data. My <code>Download.py</code> script is built to gather the historical financial information needed for the optimization process. Its main tasks include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fetching Financial Data:</strong> It systematically downloads historical stock data (like daily open, high, low, close prices, and volume) primarily from Yahoo Finance using the <code>yfinance</code> library.</li>
    <li><strong>Handling Data Challenges:</strong> Getting clean, consistent data can be tricky. The script includes logic to handle:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Business Days & Holidays:</em> Accurately identifies trading days, respecting market-specific calendars (e.g., Brazilian holidays) to avoid seeking data for non-trading periods.</li>
            <li><em>Data Gaps:</em> It checks for previously downloaded data and attempts to fill in any missing historical information.</li>
            <li><em>Efficient Downloads:</em> It maintains a "skip list" of dates for which data was previously unavailable from the source, preventing redundant failed attempts.</li>
            <li><em>Resilience:</em> Implements retries for network issues and rotates user-agents to ensure consistent data access.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Organizing Data:</strong> The downloaded data is processed and saved into a single, consolidated CSV file (<code>StockDataDB.csv</code>). This file serves as the main input for the optimization script.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why is this important?</em> Accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date historical data is the bedrock of any sound financial analysis. <code>Download.py</code> ensures our optimization engine has the quality input it needs.</p>

<h4><code>Engine.py</code>: Crafting Optimized Portfolios</h4>
<p>Once the data is ready, <code>Engine.py</code> takes over. This script is where the computational heavy lifting happens, exploring different combinations of stocks to find potentially "optimized" portfolios. Here's a look at the techniques used:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Foundation in Financial Theory:</strong> The engine's logic is rooted in <strong>Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)</strong>. The primary objective is to <strong>maximize the Sharpe Ratio</strong>, a key metric that measures return relative to risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> It ingests the data from <code>Download.py</code>, calculates daily returns for each stock, and prepares a focused pool of promising assets for analysis based on individual Sharpe Ratios.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploring Possibilities with Monte Carlo Simulation:</strong> For any given combination of stocks, the engine runs numerous simulations. In each simulation, it assigns random weights to the stocks in the portfolio and then calculates the portfolio's historical performance: Expected Annual Return, Expected Annual Volatility (Risk), and the Sharpe Ratio.</li>
    <li><strong>A Hybrid Search Strategy:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Brute-Force (for smaller portfolios):</em> For portfolios with a small number of stocks (configurable, e.g., up to 9), the engine exhaustively evaluates all possible combinations of stocks from a pre-defined list (like an ESG-focused stock list).</li>
            <li><em>Genetic Algorithms (GA) (for larger portfolios):</em> When the number of possible combinations becomes too vast for brute-force, the engine switches to a Genetic Algorithm. GAs are powerful heuristic search methods inspired by natural evolution, intelligently exploring the solution space.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Simulation:</strong> To manage computation time, the engine uses adaptive strategies. It might run fewer simulations for combinations that quickly show poor results and focus more effort on those that seem promising, or stop simulating a combination if its performance seems to have converged.</li>
    <li><strong>Refinement Phase:</strong> After the initial search, the very best combinations found can optionally be put through a refinement phase, where they are simulated many more times to get a more precise estimate of their potential performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Logging Results:</strong> The script logs the details of the best portfolio found (the stocks, how much to allocate to each, and its calculated performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio, expected return, and volatility).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why these techniques?</em> Combining brute-force for smaller, manageable problems with Genetic Algorithms for larger ones allows the engine to explore a wide range of possibilities. Monte Carlo helps understand the potential performance range of a given set of stocks, and focusing on the Sharpe Ratio provides a standard way to compare different portfolios based on risk-adjusted return.</p>

<h4>Working in Harmony</h4>
<p><code>Download.py</code> and <code>Engine.py</code> work sequentially:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, you run <code>Download.py</code> to get the latest historical stock data and save it to <code>StockDataDB.csv</code>.</li>
    <li>Then, you run <code>Engine.py</code>, which reads <code>StockDataDB.csv</code> and performs the optimization calculations based on the parameters you set.</li>
</ol>
<p>This separation keeps the code organized and makes sure the optimization is always using the data prepared by the download script.</p>
