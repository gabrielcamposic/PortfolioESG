<p>This project is a work in progress, primarily driven by my personal learning goals and interest in the field. It's shared openly for anyone interested in exploring these ideas further.</p>

<h4>Current Status:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The core logic for downloading historical data and performing portfolio optimization using a hybrid Brute-Force/Genetic Algorithm approach (focused on Sharpe Ratio) is implemented.</li>
    <li>Web-based progress monitoring is active.</li>
    <li>The project includes logging for results and performance.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Planned Features & Future Development:</h4>
<p>Here are some areas I'm considering for future development, or that could be interesting avenues for contributors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Integration of more sophisticated risk models (e.g., Conditional Value at Risk - CVaR).</li>
    <li>Backtesting framework to evaluate portfolio performance on out-of-sample data.</li>
    <li>Enhanced Genetic Algorithm operators and convergence criteria.</li>
    <li>Support for additional asset classes (e.g., bonds, cryptocurrencies).</li>
    <li>More advanced data visualization for portfolio analysis.</li>
    <li>Exploring different optimization objectives beyond just Sharpe Ratio.</li>
    <li>Parallelization of computationally intensive tasks.</li>
    <li>Improving the flexibility and user-friendliness of parameter configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Contributing:</h4>
<p>As an open-source project, contributions are very welcome! Whether it's suggesting new features, improving the code's efficiency, adding support for new data sources, enhancing the algorithms, or fixing bugs, your input is valuable. Please feel free to open issues or pull requests on the GitHub repository.</p>
